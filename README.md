# pipcmd
a very simple python tool that makes installing pip packages pretty simple. (this is obviously for people who arent very comfortable having to type commands into a console)


you need python from www.python.org


# license
i dont fucking care do what the hell you want with this (Unlicense)


# building
you need the module pyinstaller for this (all this does is make the .py into an .exe)


run pyinstaller --onefile pipcmd.py (in the same directory)



check output to see the location of the exe.
